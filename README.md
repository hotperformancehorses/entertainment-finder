## Description

As a team, we were presented with an challenge to build a website using two API's side by side that showcased our abilities with its functionality. We chose to design and deploy a page that would allow the end user to not only view details about various movies and TV shows, but also to check availability on various streaming platforms for the content. 


## Usage

Our team worked tirelessly to provide a user friendly experience for any visitors to our site. We have placed a navigation bar on top to select various genres as well as a search feature. The rest of the initial site consists of a carousel for trending movies and tv shows. When clicking on any of these, it directs the user to the search results for that specific title.

## Features

Bulma. TMBD. Side by Side API's.
